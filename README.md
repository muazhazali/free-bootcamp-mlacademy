## Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `kedro 1.3.1`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a data engineering convention
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run this app locally

There are two main ways to run this application locally: using Docker Compose (recommended) or manually using your local Python environment.

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method orchestrates the training, inference, and UI services automatically.

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed and running on your machine.
2. Open a terminal in the root of the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

4. The compose file will sequentially run:
   - `ml-train`: Trains the model.
   - `ml-inference`: Runs the inference pipeline.
   - `app-ui`: Starts the Dash web interface.
5. Once the `app-ui` service is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8050 to view the real-time bike count predictions.

### Option 2: Running Manually (Local Environment)

If you prefer to run the scripts manually without Docker, you can use the provided entrypoint scripts. We use `uv` for package management.

1. Install dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Train the model**: Run the training entrypoint to generate the models.
```bash
python entrypoints/training.py
```

4. **Run the inference**: Run the inference script in a separate terminal.
```bash
python entrypoints/inference.py
```

5. **Start the UI App**: Run the app UI in another terminal.
```bash
python entrypoints/app_ui.py
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8050.

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
pytest
```

You can configure the coverage threshold in your project's `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.coverage.report]` section.


## Project dependencies

To see and update the dependency requirements for your project use `requirements.txt`. You can install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `context`, 'session', `catalog`, and `pipelines`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can use tools like [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout). For example, you can add a hook in `.git/config` with `nbstripout --install`. This will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.
